Exercise 2a is at the bottom of Exercise2.java

Exercise 2b:

1. Demonstrate the heap sort algorithm for the following input array of integers:
3, 28, 14, -5, 6, 12, 3
Show the steps of phase 1 graphically, by means of tree structures as illustrated in Figure 2.
Show the steps of phase 2 by means of arrays as depicted in Figure 1. Include the steps in
your Java code as comments.


2. What is the order of run-time complexity of the algorithms pushUp, buildHeap, pushDown,
pickHeap, and so, of heap sort, for an array of N elements? Motivate your answer.
